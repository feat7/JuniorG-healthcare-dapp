Clone the repository somewhere and then `cd` in to the cloned directory

Then run these commands

`npm install`

`npm run dev`

It will start server in port `8000`. Make sure you have mongodb installed in your local system up and running. You also need to install metamask in your browser in order to make sure that it runs in your browser.
