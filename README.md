#### Best in Blockchain Track
#### Project by Team Junio G at Codeutsava 3.0

## Abstract:

There is a lot of illigal Organ Donation is going on around the world. So, for stoping this illegal Organ Transplantation we have made a blockchain based dApp in which if a person need a organ he can register on our platform and wait until a cadever organ(organ from a person who is dead and willing to donate his organs) is available all this data will store on ethereum based smart contract which is temperproof. We have also implemented a Govt. verifier who has ability to check weather whole process is legal or not.
